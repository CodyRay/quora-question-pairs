\title{Finding Quora questions pairs with neural networks}

% The \author macro works with any number of authors. There are two
% commands used to separate the names and addresses of multiple
% authors: \And and \AND.
%
% Using \And between authors leaves it to LaTeX to determine where to
% break the lines. Using \AND forces a line break at that point. So,
% if LaTeX puts 3 of 4 authors names on the first line, and the last
% on the second line, try using \AND instead of \And before the third
% author name.

\begin{abstract}
    The website Quora helps anybody ask and answer questions. With a 100 million monthly users, questions with the same intent are frequently asked. Questions with the same intent can lead to more overhead for Quora, readers, and writers. Quora challenged the Kaggle Community to find a better way to identify question pairs. We started with a starter Kernal from the Kaggle Community and experimented with changing the word embedding and trying different neural networks.

% Examples: feature design, preprocessing, and the prediction models etc.


\section{Results}
% section devoted to presenting / discussing the results  obtained from exploration
% possible discussion topics include:
%   what worked and what didn't?
%   How do different methods compare with each other?
%   what kind of lessons you learned from your exploration?
%   What are possible ways for future work to improve?

\section{Conclusion}
% A conclusion section that summarize your project and your effort.

% \subsection{Citations within the text}
%
% The \verb+natbib+ package will be loaded for you by default.
% Citations may be author/year or numeric, as long as you maintain
% internal consistency.  As to the format of the references themselves,
% any style is acceptable as long as it is used consistently.
%
% The documentation for \verb+natbib+ may be found at
% \begin{center}
%     \url{http://mirrors.ctan.org/macros/latex/contrib/natbib/natnotes.pdf}
% \end{center}
% Of note is the command \verb+\citet+, which produces citations
% appropriate for use in inline text.  For example,
% \begin{verbatim}
%     \citet{hasselmo} investigated\dots
% \end{verbatim}
% produces
% \begin{quote}
%     Hasselmo, et al.\ (1995) investigated\dots
% \end{quote}
%
% If you wish to load the \verb+natbib+ package with options, you may
% add the following before loading the \verb+nips_2017+ package:
% \begin{verbatim}
%     \PassOptionsToPackage{options}{natbib}
% \end{verbatim}
%
% If \verb+natbib+ clashes with another package you load, you can add
% the optional argument \verb+nonatbib+ when loading the style file:
% \begin{verbatim}
%     \usepackage[nonatbib]{nips_2017}
% \end{verbatim}
%
% As submission is double blind, refer to your own published work in the
% third person. That is, use ``In the previous work of Jones et
% al.\ [4],'' not ``In our previous work [4].'' If you cite your other
% papers that are not widely available (e.g., a journal paper under
% review), use anonymous author names in the citation, e.g., an author
% of the form ``A.\ Anonymous.''
%
%
% \subsection{Tables}
%
% All tables must be centered, neat, clean and legible.  The table
% number and title always appear before the table.  See
% Table~\ref{sample-table}.
%
% Place one line space before the table title, one line space after the
% table title, and one line space after the table. The table title must
% be lower case (except for first word and proper nouns); tables are
% numbered consecutively.
%
% Note that publication-quality tables \emph{do not contain vertical
%   rules.} We strongly suggest the use of the \verb+booktabs+ package,
% which allows for typesetting high-quality, professional tables:
% \begin{center}
%   \url{https://www.ctan.org/pkg/booktabs}
% \end{center}
% This package was used to typeset Table~\ref{sample-table}.
%
% \begin{table}[t]
%   \caption{Sample table title}
%   \label{sample-table}
%   \centering
%   \begin{tabular}{lll}
%     \toprule
%     \multicolumn{2}{c}{Part}                   \\
%     \cmidrule{1-2}
%     Name     & Description     & Size ($\mu$m) \\
%     \midrule
%     Dendrite & Input terminal  & $\sim$100     \\
%     Axon     & Output terminal & $\sim$10      \\
%     Soma     & Cell body       & up to $10^6$  \\
%     \bottomrule
%   \end{tabular}
% \end{table}
